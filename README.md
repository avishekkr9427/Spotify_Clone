Spotify Clone is a front-end web application designed to replicate the core look and feel of a modern music streaming platform. The project focuses on creating an interactive and responsive user interface similar to Spotify, allowing users to explore songs, playlists, and control music playback in a smooth and engaging way.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong emphasis on clean UI design and real-world functionality. The layout includes a sidebar for navigation, playlist sections, song cards, and a bottom music player interface. Semantic HTML is used to structure the content properly, while CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid are applied to create a responsive design that works well across different screen sizes.

JavaScript is used to add core functionality to the project. It handles features such as play and pause controls, song switching, progress bar updates, and dynamic UI interactions. The music player responds to user actions in real time, providing a realistic streaming experience. The logic is written in a clear and structured manner to keep the code readable and easy to maintain.

Special attention is given to styling details like hover effects, icons, spacing, and color themes to closely match a professional music streaming interface. Reusable components and organized files make the project scalable for future enhancements.

Working on this project strengthened my understanding of frontend development, DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive UI design. This Spotify Clone demonstrates my ability to convert a real-world application concept into a functional and visually appealing web project, making it a strong addition to my portfolio.
